					    ## Big Talk Leader Responsibilities
					    * It’s your responsibility to **get the conversation started** but you are not leading the conversation. The question is not “your” question for the group to answer; it is the group’s question to discuss.
					    * You should **not** sit in a [power position](https://www.richardwinters.com/seats) at the table. 
					    * **Moderate conversation.** Watch for people taking up too much airtime — yourself included – and intervene when necessary.
					    * **Make sure conversations don’t become 1on1**. Engage and break the conversation up (redirect it, make a new point, whatever) when necessary.
					    * **Protect the safe space**. Rigorous discussion about ideas is encouraged! Offensive or aggressive discussion directed towards individuals is off-limits.
